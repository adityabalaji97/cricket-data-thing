## 📖 Overview

### What We're Building
A unified, automated pipeline that processes cricket data from Cricsheet JSON files into a fully populated PostgreSQL database with all analytical columns and statistics.

### Why We Need This
Currently, processing new cricket match data requires running 7+ separate scripts manually, with CSV exports/imports in between. This is:
- Time-consuming and error-prone
- Leaves the database in inconsistent states
- Requires manual intervention for player data
- Not optimized for our 1.6M+ delivery records

### What Success Looks Like
```bash
# Single command to process new matches
python unified_pipeline.py --process-new-matches /path/to/json/files/

# Single command to refresh existing data
python unified_pipeline.py --refresh-all-data

# Result: Fully processed database with all columns populated
```

## 🔍 Current State Analysis

### Existing Scripts and Their Roles

| Script | Purpose | Input | Output | Issues |
|--------|---------|-------|--------|--------|
| `loadMatches.py` | Load basic match/delivery data | JSON files | Matches + Deliveries (basic) | Missing new columns |
| `statsProcessor.py` | Generate batting/bowling stats | Deliveries | BattingStats + BowlingStats | Fails if players missing |
| `venue_standardization.py` | Clean venue names | Matches | Updated venue names | Standalone process |
| `update_player_info_enhanced.py` | Find/fix missing players | Database | CSV + Updates | Manual CSV editing |
| `delivery_column_updater.py` | Populate delivery columns | Players + Deliveries | Enhanced delivery columns | Newly created |
| `update_crease_combo_granular.py` | Enhance crease combinations | Deliveries | Granular crease combos | One-time migration |

### Current Processing Flow Problems
1. **Fragmented**: Each script runs independently
2. **Manual**: Requires human intervention for player data
3. **Incomplete**: New matches missing enhanced columns
4. **Inefficient**: Multiple database passes for same data
5. **Error-prone**: No coordination between scripts

## 📝 Step-by-Step Implementation Instructions

### Step 1: Create Player Discovery Service

#### 1.1 Create the File
```bash
touch /Users/adityabalaji/cdt/cricket-data-thing/player_discovery.py
```

#### 1.2 Core Structure
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
Player Discovery Service

Automatically discovers missing players from JSON files and creates
placeholder entries in the players table.
"""

import json
import os
from pathlib import Path
from typing import Dict, Set, List, Optional, NamedTuple
from dataclasses import dataclass
from sqlalchemy.orm import Session
from database import get_database_connection
from models import Player

@dataclass
class PlayerInfo:
    name: str
    appears_as: List[str]  # ['batter', 'bowler', 'both']
    team_countries: Set[str]  # Teams they've played for
    match_count: int
    ball_count: int
    likely_nationality: Optional[str] = None

class PlayerDiscoveryService:
    def __init__(self):
        # Implementation details here
        pass
    
    def scan_json_files_for_players(self, json_directory: str) -> Dict[str, PlayerInfo]:
        """Scan all JSON files and extract player information"""
        # Implementation details here
        pass
    
    def find_missing_players(self, discovered_players: Dict[str, PlayerInfo]) -> Dict[str, PlayerInfo]:
        """Compare discovered players with database and find missing ones"""
        # Implementation details here
        pass
    
    def create_placeholder_players(self, missing_players: Dict[str, PlayerInfo]) -> int:
        """Create placeholder entries for missing players"""
        # Implementation details here
        pass
```

#### 1.3 Implementation Details
Focus on these key methods:

**Method 1: `scan_json_files_for_players`**
- Loop through all JSON files in directory
- Extract batter, non_striker, bowler from each delivery
- Track team associations for nationality inference
- Count appearances and contexts

**Method 2: `find_missing_players`**
- Query existing players table
- Compare with discovered players
- Return difference with metadata

**Method 3: `create_placeholder_players`**
- Create Player objects with discovered info
- Set nationality based on team patterns
- Mark records as auto-discovered
- Bulk insert for efficiency

### Step 2: Enhance LoadMatches Script

#### 2.1 Copy and Enhance Existing Script
```bash
cp /Users/adityabalaji/cdt/cricket-data-thing/dataloader/loadMatches.py /Users/adityabalaji/cdt/cricket-data-thing/enhanced_loadMatches.py
```

#### 2.2 Key Enhancements to Add

**Enhanced Delivery Creation**:
```python
def create_enhanced_delivery(ball_data: dict, match_context: dict, session: Session) -> Delivery:
    """Create delivery with all enhancement columns populated"""
    delivery = Delivery(
        # ... existing fields ...
    )
    
    # Populate enhancement columns during creation
    delivery.striker_batter_type = get_player_batter_type(ball_data['batter'], session)
    delivery.non_striker_batter_type = get_player_batter_type(ball_data['non_striker'], session)
    delivery.bowler_type = get_player_bowler_type(ball_data['bowler'], session)
    
    # Calculate derived columns
    delivery.crease_combo = calculate_crease_combo(delivery.striker_batter_type, delivery.non_striker_batter_type)
    delivery.ball_direction = calculate_ball_direction(delivery.striker_batter_type, delivery.bowler_type)
    
    return delivery
```

**Player Integration**:
```python
def ensure_players_exist(json_file: str, session: Session) -> None:
    """Ensure all players from match exist in players table"""
    discovery_service = PlayerDiscoveryService()
    missing_players = discovery_service.scan_single_file(json_file)
    if missing_players:
        discovery_service.create_placeholder_players(missing_players)
```

### Step 3: Create Data Validator

#### 3.1 Create Validation Framework
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
Data Validator

Validates data completeness and generates quality reports.
"""

from typing import Dict, List, Optional
from sqlalchemy import text
from database import get_database_connection

@dataclass
class ValidationResult:
    component: str
    status: str  # 'PASS', 'WARN', 'FAIL'
    message: str
    details: Optional[Dict] = None

class DataValidator:
    def __init__(self):
        self.engine, SessionLocal = get_database_connection()
        self.session = SessionLocal()
    
    def validate_delivery_columns(self) -> List[ValidationResult]:
        """Validate delivery enhancement columns"""
        results = []
        
        # Check striker_batter_type completeness
        query = text("""
            SELECT 
                COUNT(*) as total,
                COUNT(striker_batter_type) as populated,
                COUNT(CASE WHEN striker_batter_type = 'unknown' THEN 1 END) as unknown
            FROM deliveries
        """)
        # ... implementation
        
        return results
    
    def validate_player_completeness(self) -> List[ValidationResult]:
        """Validate player data completeness"""
        # ... implementation
        pass
    
    def generate_report(self) -> str:
        """Generate comprehensive data quality report"""
        # ... implementation
        pass
```

### Step 4: Create Unified Pipeline Orchestrator

#### 4.1 Core Pipeline Structure
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
Unified Cricket Data Pipeline

Orchestrates all data processing components for complete automation.
"""

    def update_players_and_refresh(self, player_names: List[str]) -> PipelineResults:
        """Update specific players and refresh affected deliveries"""
        pass
```

#### 4.2 Configuration Management
Create `pipeline_config.json`:
```json
{
    "batch_sizes": {
        "match_loading": 100,
        "delivery_updates": 25000,
        "statistics": 50
    },
    "timeouts": {
        "discovery_phase": 300,
        "loading_phase": 1800,
        "enhancement_phase": 600
    },
    "validation": {
        "required_columns": ["striker_batter_type", "bowler_type", "crease_combo"],
        "min_completeness_percent": 95
    },
    "logging": {
        "level": "INFO",
        "file": "pipeline.log"
    }
}
```

### Step 5: Integration and Testing

#### 5.1 Unit Testing Each Component
Create test files for each component:
```bash
touch test_player_discovery.py
touch test_enhanced_loadMatches.py
touch test_data_validator.py
touch test_unified_pipeline.py
```

#### 5.2 Integration Testing
```python
# test_integration.py
def test_full_pipeline_with_sample_data():
    """Test complete pipeline with small dataset"""
    # Create test JSON files
    # Run pipeline
    # Validate results
    pass

def test_pipeline_error_recovery():
    """Test pipeline behavior with errors"""
    # Introduce errors
    # Verify graceful handling
    pass
```

#### 5.3 Performance Testing
```python
# test_performance.py
def test_bulk_operations_performance():
    """Test performance with large datasets"""
    # Measure processing time
    # Verify memory usage
    # Check database locks
    pass
```

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing Approach
Each component should have comprehensive unit tests covering:
- Happy path scenarios
- Error conditions
- Edge cases (empty data, malformed JSON, etc.)
- Performance with large datasets

### Integration Testing Approach
- Test complete pipeline with small dataset (10-20 matches)
- Test pipeline with realistic dataset (1000+ matches)
- Test error recovery and rollback scenarios
- Test incremental vs. full processing modes

### Performance Testing Approach
- Benchmark against current manual process
- Test with full 1.6M delivery dataset
- Monitor memory usage and database performance
- Verify bulk operations efficiency

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Issue: "Player not found" errors during loading
**Symptoms**: Pipeline fails during match loading
**Cause**: Player discovery didn't create all needed players
**Solution**: 
1. Check player discovery logs
2. Manually run player discovery on failed files
3. Verify players table has required entries

#### Issue: Slow bulk operations
**Symptoms**: Pipeline takes too long to complete
**Cause**: Batch sizes too large or database contention
**Solution**:
1. Reduce batch sizes in configuration
2. Check database indexes on frequently joined columns
3. Monitor database locks during processing

#### Issue: Inconsistent delivery column data
**Symptoms**: Some deliveries have null enhancement columns
**Cause**: Players added after initial delivery loading
**Solution**:
1. Run delivery column updater for specific players
2. Check player data completeness
3. Re-run enhancement phase if needed

### Debugging Tips
1. **Enable verbose logging**: Set `PIPELINE_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG`
2. **Use smaller datasets**: Test with 10-20 matches first
3. **Check database state**: Validate each phase completion
4. **Monitor performance**: Use database query logs to find bottlenecks

### Error Recovery
The pipeline includes rollback capabilities:
```bash
# Rollback failed pipeline run
python unified_pipeline.py --rollback --transaction-id abc123

# Resume from specific phase
python unified_pipeline.py --resume --from-phase enhancement
```

## 📊 Monitoring and Maintenance

### Performance Metrics to Track
- Processing time per phase
- Deliveries processed per minute
- Memory usage during bulk operations
- Database lock duration

### Regular Maintenance Tasks
- Monitor player data completeness (weekly)
- Validate delivery column accuracy (monthly)
- Performance optimization review (quarterly)
- Update player discovery rules as needed

### Alerts and Notifications
Set up monitoring for:
- Pipeline failures
- Performance degradation
- Data quality issues
- Disk space usage during processing
