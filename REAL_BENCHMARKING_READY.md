🎯 **Real Benchmarking Implemented!**

## ✅ **What's Changed:**

### **Intelligent Contextual Benchmarking:**
- **IPL teams** (CSK, RCB, MI, etc.) → Compared against other IPL teams
- **International teams** (Australia, India, etc.) → Compared against other international teams
- **Other leagues** (BBL, CPL, etc.) → Compared against teams from same league

### **Real Statistical Calculations:**
```sql
-- Uses actual percentile_cont() functions
SELECT percentile_cont(0.25) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY team_avg) as p25,
       percentile_cont(0.50) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY team_avg) as p50,
       percentile_cont(0.75) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY team_avg) as p75
```

### **Example Output:**
```
CSK: 45 matches, PP Avg: 78.5%ile, PP SR: 65.2%ile (IPL Teams, 9 benchmark teams)
Australia: 23 matches, PP Avg: 45.1%ile, PP SR: 82.3%ile (International Teams, 15 benchmark teams)
```

### **Robust Error Handling:**
- Falls back to simple normalization if < 3 benchmark teams
- Handles null averages (when no wickets taken in phase)
- Graceful handling of edge cases (all teams same performance)

### **Test Commands:**
```bash
# Test single team with real benchmarking
python test_team_phase_stats.py

# Test multiple teams comparison  
python debug_phase_stats.py
```

### **Frontend Integration:**
The radar chart now shows **true percentile rankings** where:
- **80%ile+** = Top 20% performer in their context
- **50%ile** = Median performer 
- **20%ile-** = Bottom 20% performer

**Try CSK vs RCB now** - you'll see real comparative performance! 🏏
